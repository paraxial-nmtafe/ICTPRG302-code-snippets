# Extra exercises
> These exercises are not mandatory! They are for practice.

The class wants more exercises, so I shall attempt to provide.

(For those who know what I mean, please stick to the standard library and don't import anything.)

There are *possible solutions* on the branch called `answers`.  
These are not full answers, they are just one of many solutions.

If you're keeping up with RIoT, this is good practice to switch branches and keep 
an eye on your git log as well ðŸ˜„.

## 04: Loops

- There's a week 4 revision exercise in Blackboard to print multiplication tables
- I will also add the following: various_pointy_trees.py

## 07, 08: Dictionary & List Exercises

- Have a read through [[./collections.md]]
- media_list.py just helps you understand that lists can contain dictionaries as elements.
- star_ratings.py is probably a good extension to the problems we tried during class.
