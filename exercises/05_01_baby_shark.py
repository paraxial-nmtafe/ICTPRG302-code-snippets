# Recall that functions can let you do similar things over and over.

# Using functions, print the lyrics to "Baby Shark"

# For reference, the lyrics are included at the bottom of this file.
# (I am very sorry if you now have this song in your head.)


# A suggestion to start:

def print_song_verse(line_prefix):
    # The verses of baby shark are very similar to each other
    # This function could be used to reduce some repetition.
    # Get rid of this pass statement when you write your own code:
    pass

# This will print the first verse.  How will you print the others?
print_song_verse("Baby Shark")


# Extension: Could you use loops as well?
