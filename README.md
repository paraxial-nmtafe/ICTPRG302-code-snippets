# README
This repository is not meant as anything but a collection of snippets that have been written live in class during NMTAFE's ICTPRG302, by me.  It is intended for educational purposes only.

*It does not represent a single "good" way to write any particular code.*

The intent of this repository is __only__ for the reference of students who are going back over the lecture recordings and want to look at the code holistically.

## Usage
You may run any file in this repo by doing:

```bash
python -d <filename>
``` 

(if you are using the command line.)  

Alternatively, you may use the 'run' button in your IDE of choice.

This is Ian - Hello
